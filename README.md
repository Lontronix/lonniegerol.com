# Lonnie's Personal Website

This is my personal website, it was written in Javascript and uses the [SvelteKit framework](https://kit.svelte.dev/)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
2. start the development server `npm run dev` or `npm run dev -- --open` (the latter automatically opens the site in your default browser)

## Building

To create a production version:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
